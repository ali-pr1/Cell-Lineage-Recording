# As I understood dox_barc_mat columns represents sequences. I don't understand how that works, why some are negative some are positive and what is represented by different values?
# dropping <75 intersection? why you want bc1+bc2>0?
# symmetric n* n+1 matrix filled with hamming distance
# symmetric means upper tringle
# what is editable barcode frequency in Duncan's codes?
# how should I do the statics and dynamics
# how tree estimator function works?
# some how most improtant thing is to adopt tree estimatior for our setup i.e 9 dynamic barcodes and 6 static barcodes, dynamics
# are equivalent to 1 bit and statics to 2 bits of information. any notes on that?
# jointly measured barcodes, what's that about?
